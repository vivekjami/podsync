## üöÄ What is PodSync?

PodSync is my answer to the question: "What if we could build something better than Riverside.fm?" 

This isn't just another video conferencing tool - it's a complete podcasting ecosystem that I've architected from the ground up. The platform supports **up to 10 participants** in real-time calls while simultaneously recording studio-quality audio locally. What makes it special? The AI magic that happens after your recording ends - automatic transcription, speaker identification, audio cleanup, and intelligent summaries.

This project represents my journey from being comfortable with traditional web development to diving deep into the complex worlds of WebRTC, real-time media processing, and AI integration. Every line of code tells a story of late nights, breakthrough moments, and the satisfaction of solving incredibly challenging problems.

## ‚ú® Why I Built This

As someone who's worked extensively with React, Next.js, and Django, I wanted to push my boundaries. I've built fintech tools, decentralized applications, and won hackathons, but PodSync was my chance to tackle something that combines everything I love about software engineering:

- **Real-time Systems**: WebRTC for live streaming
- **AI Integration**: Whisper, pyannote-audio, and GPT for post-processing  
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle 10+ participants reliably
- **Production-Grade Infrastructure**: Docker, GCP Cloud Run, CI/CD pipelines
- **Modern Frontend**: Next.js with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture That Scales

### **The Challenge: 10-Person Calls**
Supporting 10 people in a single call isn't just about connecting more peers - it's about completely rethinking the architecture. Here's how I solved it:

**Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) Architecture**
- Peer-to-peer works great for 2-3 people, but becomes a nightmare with 10
- Each participant would need 9 connections = 45 total connections for 10 people
- My solution: Implement a media server (Mediasoup) that receives streams from all participants and selectively forwards them

**Dual-Quality Streams**  
- **Real-time**: Lower bitrate for live conversation (optimized for latency)
- **Recording**: High bitrate local recording for studio quality (optimized for quality)

**Smart Bandwidth Management**
- Dynamic quality adaptation based on network conditions
- Priority system: audio > active speaker video > other participants
- Background upload throttling during live sessions

### **Tech Stack Decisions**

**Frontend: Next.js + TypeScript**
- Server-side rendering for better SEO and performance
- Type safety throughout the application
- Tailwind CSS for rapid, consistent styling
- Socket.IO for real-time communication

**Backend: Node.js + Express**
- WebSocket server for WebRTC signaling
- RESTful APIs for session management
- MongoDB for user data and session metadata
- Google Cloud Storage for media files

**Media Processing**
- **Mediasoup**: Open-source SFU for scalable real-time communication
- **FFmpeg**: Audio/video processing and layout rendering
- **OpenAI Whisper**: State-of-the-art speech recognition
- **Pyannote-audio**: Speaker diarization and identification

**AI Pipeline**
- **Transcription**: Whisper handles 680k+ hours of training data
- **Speaker ID**: Pyannote identifies who said what
- **Audio Cleanup**: Noise reduction and normalization
- **Summarization**: GPT-4 generates session highlights

**Infrastructure**
- **Docker**: Containerized deployment
- **GCP Cloud Run**: Serverless container hosting
- **GitHub Actions**: Automated CI/CD
- **Vercel**: Frontend deployment
- **Stripe**: Payment processing

## üìö My Learning Journey

### **WebRTC: From "Simple" to "Holy Complexity"**

When I started, I thought WebRTC was just about connecting two browsers. How hard could it be?

**The Reality Check**: WebRTC is a maze of protocols, signaling servers, STUN/TURN servers, ICE candidates, and NAT traversal. My first "successful" connection only worked on localhost. The moment I tried it across different networks, everything broke.

**The Breakthrough**: Understanding that WebRTC is not just peer-to-peer. For 10-person calls, you need an SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit). I spent weeks learning about media servers, studying Mediasoup documentation, and implementing proper fallback mechanisms.

**Key Learning**: Real-time communication is incredibly complex, but the user experience should feel effortless.

### **The Resumable Upload Challenge**

Picture this: You just recorded a 2-hour podcast with 10 people. That's potentially 20GB of high-quality media files. Now imagine your upload fails at 95% completion.

**The Problem**: Traditional file uploads don't handle large files gracefully. Network interruptions, browser crashes, or simply closing the tab would mean starting over.

**The Solution**: I implemented the TUS (Transloadit Upload Server) protocol with chunked uploads:
- Split large files into 5-10MB chunks
- Upload chunks in parallel with retry logic
- Store upload state in IndexedDB for crash recovery
- Resumable from any point of failure

**The Tools**: Uppy.js with Golden Retriever plugin became my best friend. It handles all the complexity while providing a beautiful upload UI.

**Key Learning**: User experience is everything. Nobody should lose their content due to technical failures.

### **AI Integration: Making Computers Understand Speech**

Integrating AI wasn't just about calling an API - it was about building a reliable pipeline that processes hours of audio content.

**Whisper Integration**:
- Handles multilingual content (supports 99+ languages)
- Robust against background noise and varying audio quality
- Processes individual tracks vs. mixed audio for better accuracy

**Speaker Diarization Challenge**:
- Whisper gives you text, but not who said what
- Pyannote-audio identifies speaker segments
- The magic happens in aligning timestamps between the two

**Processing Pipeline**:
```
Audio Files ‚Üí FFmpeg Processing ‚Üí Whisper (Transcription) 
                                ‚Üì
Speaker Segments ‚Üê Pyannote-audio
                                ‚Üì
Combined Transcript ‚Üí GPT-4 (Summarization)
```

**Key Learning**: AI is powerful, but the real value is in the integration and user experience around it.

### **Scaling to 10 Participants: The Architecture Evolution**

**Attempt 1: Peer-to-Peer Mesh**
- Works great for 2-3 people
- Becomes exponentially complex with more participants
- Network requirements: n(n-1)/2 connections
- For 10 people: 45 connections! Each person uploads to 9 others.

**Attempt 2: SFU (Selective Forwarding Unit)**
- One media server receives all streams
- Selectively forwards streams to participants
- Each participant: 1 upload + 9 downloads
- Much more efficient and scalable

**Implementation Reality**:
- Set up Mediasoup server for media routing
- Handle dynamic participant joining/leaving
- Implement bandwidth adaptation
- Manage audio/video quality layers

**Key Learning**: Sometimes you need to completely rethink your approach to scale.
