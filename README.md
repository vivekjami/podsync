✅ **Real-Time Expertise**: Deep WebRTC knowledge with SFU architecture  
✅ **AI Integration**: Practical experience with Whisper, GPT, and audio ML  
✅ **DevOps Excellence**: Full CI/CD with monitoring, alerts, and auto-scaling  
✅ **Business Acumen**: Built with clear monetization and growth strategy  

### 🌟 **Ready to Build Your Next Big Thing**
I'm actively seeking **Senior Software Engineer** opportunities where I can:
- **Architect Scalable Systems** that handle millions of users reliably
- **Lead Technical Initiatives** in real-time communications, AI, or media processing
- **Mentor Development Teams** and drive engineering excellence
- **Solve Complex Problems** that have real business impact

**🚀 Available for**: Full-time roles, technical leadership, or consulting
